preproccesor todo:
sort all the command search options and all, clean those up or something.
this is mostyl for allow_existance_boolean stuff


cast booleans

can i do regex casting too?

cast dates
-- accept timezone arg


// make sure tests for mongoer and mongo and memory use the preprocessor




for the preprocessor?
# it 'should unroll negations with dates' do
# end


rename command_dealiaser to normalizer and put the sql preprocess stuff there?


make sure compares are in order in normalizer?
this might already be done in parser or somewhere,
in which case theres some lines in mongoer that can
maybe be removed


is there currently injection via saying its numeric and then passing in as a string/whatnot?
