need to do something like this
Regexp.new('\b' + Regexp.escape(str) + '\b', 'i')
or
Regexp.new(Regexp.escape(str), 'i')
as opposed to the literals like
/#{Regexp.escape(str)}/i
to avoid building the wrong regexes when there is a special character (like 'A+')

look into how this handles apostrophes.

so "bee's knee" does not think its an unbalanced quote or so.

specs already have some good test data for that

{ title: "someone's iHat", feathers: 8, cost: 100, fav_date: "1.week.ago" }

what about "foo's unquoted bar's" unquoted should not be quoted

update readme to show that CommandSearch takes 3 arguments, the last being the options.
