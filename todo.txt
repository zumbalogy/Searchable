look at letting the search field take strings or symbols.

show example using aliases to support commas in numbers
/#{word_break}[,\d]+#{word_break}/ => -> (match) { match.tr(',', '') }
or something. that does not validate commas being every 3. maybe:
/(?<=\d),\d\d\d/

look into
Even with existence boolean, this should maybe check that the existing value is not false.
in mongoer.rb, memory.rb might need that too.

consider things like:
opt(':').should == [{ type: :str, value: ':' }]
so people can search emoji without quotes.
(clean_ununused_syntax in parser.rb)

Make sure the aliaser (and rest of command search) plays friendly with pagination for mongo and in memory.

Aliaser, currently string alaises wont match halves of command. should be thought about and noted somewhere.
'red' => 'blue',
a('house:red').should == 'house:red'

maybe support a real regex type. using that could mean certain things are not needed.

the query "foo:-bar" errors out, should lex "foo:" as a command itself,
then wont need ':' lexer or avoiding ':' in str lexer.
