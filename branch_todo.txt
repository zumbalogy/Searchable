make a thing that can test against diff versions (ruby versions or activerecord/bds maybe or diff docker images for diff db versions)

note in readme about
how mysql5 and mariaDB need to be specific to use old mysql
(and switch docs to use the "command_search.build" fn maybe


break fuzzing out into own test file.

maybe does not work



---

test against diff versions of sqlite.


--
gem 'simplecov'
get 100% test coverage for units (command_search only one missing i think)


ironically: simpleCov only works with ruby>2.5, thus i had to remove it to get better "coverage" (of the actually relevant type. could have maybe downgraded it or such but not worth the time).


--------

merge two github actions into one file



----

skip osx for the tests
