note in readme about
how mysql5 and mariaDB need to be specific to use old mysql

maybe does not work

test against diff versions of sqlite.


--
gem 'simplecov'
get 100% test coverage for units (command_search only one missing i think)


ironically: simpleCov only works with ruby>2.5, thus i had to remove it to get better "coverage" (of the actually relevant type. could have maybe downgraded it or such but not worth the time).
